# Learn Ruby the Hard Way

## Summary

Before starting at Makers Academy I studied the online book [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/) by Zed Shaw.

This repo contains the exercises that I worked through in the book. The book was heavy-going at times but really helped me to consolidate my understanding of some key principles of the Ruby language.
